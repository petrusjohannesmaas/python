### Pomodoro Breakdown:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime
```

- **`import json`**: This allows the program to work with JSON data. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to structure data. In this case, you're using a JSON file to store tasks and prompts.
- **`from datetime import datetime`**: This imports Python's `datetime` module, allowing us to get the current date and time, which we use to create a unique file name each day.

---

### The `show_tasks` function:

```python
def show_tasks(tasks):  
    task_results = []
```

- **Function definition**: `show_tasks` is a function that takes `tasks` as input. `tasks` is a dictionary loaded from the JSON file.
- **`task_results = []`**: This is a list that will store all the tasks and responses as strings. After going through all tasks, we'll write this list to a `.txt` file.

---

```python
    for task_id, task_data in tasks.items():
        # Display task and its details
        print(f"[Task:] {task_id}")
        for item in task_data:
            print(f"  - {item}")
        print()

        task_results.append(f"[Task:] {task_id}\n")
        task_results.extend([f"  - {item}\n" for item in task_data])
```

- **`for task_id, task_data in tasks.items():`**: This loops through each task in the `tasks` dictionary. `task_id` refers to the name of the task (e.g., "Research", "Rehydration"), and `task_data` is a list of task details (e.g., the action and the duration).
- **`print(f"[Task:] {task_id}")`**: This prints the task name to the console.
- **`for item in task_data:`**: This loops through each item in the list (e.g., the task description and duration) and prints them.
- **`task_results.append()`**: Adds the task name to the list `task_results`.
- **`task_results.extend([f"  - {item}\n" for item in task_data])`**: Adds the task details (description and time) to `task_results` as a list comprehension.

---

```python
        response = input("Next task (N) or skip (S)? ").lower()
        result = f"{task_id} completed.\n" if response == "n" else f"{task_id} skipped.\n"
        task_results.append(result)
```

- **`input()`**: Asks the user if they want to move to the next task or skip it. `.lower()` makes the input lowercase so both "N" and "n" are valid.
- **`if-else` shorthand (ternary)**: This is a one-line `if-else` statement. If the user types `n`, the task is marked as completed, otherwise, it's marked as skipped.
- **`task_results.append(result)`**: Adds the result (completed or skipped) to the list `task_results`.

---

### Saving to a `.txt` file:

```python
    file_name = f"{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.txt"
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines(task_results)
    
    print(f"Task results saved to {file_name}")
```

- **`datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')`**: This gets the current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. The `strftime` method formats the date into a string.
- **`file_name = f"{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.txt"`**: This creates a file name that is the current date followed by `.txt` (e.g., `2024-10-03.txt`).
- **`with open(file_name, 'w') as file:`**: Opens (or creates) the file in "write" mode (`'w'`), which means it will overwrite any existing file with the same name.
- **`file.writelines(task_results)`**: Writes each item in the `task_results` list to the file.
- **`print(f"Task results saved to {file_name}")`**: Lets the user know that the task results were saved.

---

### The `main` function:

```python
def main():
    with open("data.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    response = input(data["prompts"]["greet"][0]).lower()
    if response == "y":
        show_tasks(data["tasks"])
    else:
        print("Goodbye!")
```

- **`with open("data.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:`**: Opens the `data.json` file for reading (`'r'`). The `encoding="utf-8"` ensures the file is read with the correct character encoding.
- **`data = json.load(f)`**: Loads the JSON data from the file into a Python dictionary called `data`.
- **`response = input(data["prompts"]["greet"][0]).lower()`**: Asks the user a question (from the `greet` key in the JSON file) and stores the response.
- **`if response == "y":`**: If the user types "y", the `show_tasks()` function is called to start showing the tasks.
- **`else: print("Goodbye!")`**: If the user doesn't type "y", the program exits.

---

### The `__name__ == "__main__"` part:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- This line checks if the script is being run directly. If it is, it calls the `main()` function. This is a standard Python practice that allows your code to be used as a module or run directly.

---

### Summary:

1. The program reads tasks from a `data.json` file.
2. It shows the tasks to the user, allowing them to either complete or skip each task.
3. The results (completed or skipped) are saved to a `.txt` file named with the current date.
4. The user interacts with the program via prompts and can quit at the start if they choose not to run through the tasks.

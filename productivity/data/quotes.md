 - "To escape boredom, man works either beyond what his usual needs require, or else he invents play, that is, work that is designed to quiet no need other than that for working in general." Friedrich Nietzsche 

- "He who completely entrenches himself against boredom also entrenches himself, against himself. He will never get to drink the most potent, refreshing draught from the deepest well of his own being" Friedrich Nietzsche

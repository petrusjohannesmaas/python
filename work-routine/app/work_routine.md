Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code and its functionality, which you can include in your study journal:

### Overview
This Python application helps manage tasks by prompting the user to select an option for each task and asking if they completed the session. The task progress and session completion status are logged in a text file for later review.

The application reads tasks from a JSON file, displays them to the user, and interacts with them through the command line to track their progress.

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **Importing Modules**:
   ```python
   import json
   from datetime import datetime
   ```
   - `json`: This is used to read the task data from a JSON file.
   - `datetime`: Used to create a timestamp for the log file name, so each session is recorded with the date.

2. **The `display_tasks` Function**:
   This function is the core of the program. It shows the tasks to the user, allows them to select an option, and asks if they completed the task.

   - **Iterating through tasks**:
     ```python
     for task_name, task_options in tasks.items():
         print(f"Task: {task_name}")
     ```
     - This loops over each task category (`task_name`) and displays the options associated with it (`task_options`).

   - **Displaying options**:
     ```python
     for option in task_options:
         for key, description in option.items():
             print(f"  {key}. {description}")
     ```
     - For each task, it lists the options (1, 2, 3). Each option has a number (`key`) and a description (`description`).

   - **User input to choose or skip**:
     ```python
     response = input(f"Choose an option (1, 2, 3) or skip (S): ").lower()
     ```
     - The user is asked to pick one of the numbered options or skip the task by typing 'S'. Their response is processed to ensure valid input.

   - **Recording the chosen task or skipping**:
     ```python
     if response in ["1", "2", "3"]:
         selected_option = [opt[response] for opt in task_options if response in opt]
         task_log.append(f"{task_name}: {selected_option[0]} (selected)\n")
     ```
     - If the user chooses an option (1, 2, or 3), the program logs their selection by adding it to a `task_log` list.
     - If the user chooses to skip the task (`response == "s"`), it logs the task as skipped.

   - **Asking about session completion**:
     ```python
     session_complete = input("Did you complete a full session? (Y/N): ").lower()
     if session_complete == "y":
         task_log.append(f"  Session completed: Yes\n")
     else:
         task_log.append(f"  Session completed: No\n")
     ```
     - After selecting a task, the user is asked whether they completed a full session. If they respond 'Y', the log marks the session as completed; otherwise, it records it as incomplete.

3. **Saving the Task Log**:
   ```python
   file_name = f"{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}_task_log.txt"
   with open(file_name, "w") as file:
       file.writelines(task_log)
   ```
   - Once all tasks have been processed, the task log is saved to a text file. The filename includes the current date (e.g., `2024-10-04_task_log.txt`), making it easier to manage logs for different days.

4. **The `main` Function**:
   ```python
   def main():
       with open("data.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
           data = json.load(f)

       response = input(data["prompts"]["greet"][0]).lower()

       if response == "y":
           display_tasks(data["tasks"])
       else:
           print("Goodbye!")
   ```
   - This function reads the task data from a JSON file (`data.json`), which contains tasks and prompts.
   - It greets the user and asks if they are ready to begin. If they respond 'Y', the tasks are displayed. If not, the program exits.

5. **Entry Point of the Program**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```
   - This ensures that the `main` function is executed when the script is run. It kicks off the entire task processing workflow.

### JSON Structure

The tasks and prompts are stored in a `data.json` file with the following structure:
```json
{
    "tasks": {
        "Practise theory": [
            {"1" : "Drill Python syntax exercises"},
            {"2" : "Study towards certificate"},
            {"3" : "Read documentation"}
        ],
        "Work": [
            {"1" : "Apply business logic with Python"},
            {"2" : "Work on containerization"},
            {"3" : "Administration"}
        ],
        "Capstone": [
            {"1" : "Write an article"},
            {"2" : "Work on containerization"},
            {"3" : "Administration & maintenance"}
        ]
    },
    "prompts": {
        "greet": [
            "Is your coffee ready? type (Y) for your first task, or else to quit."
        ]
    }
}
```
- **Tasks**: Each task has a list of 3 numbered options that represent different activities for that task.
- **Prompts**: There is a greeting prompt to welcome the user when they start the session.

### What the Code Does:
- Prompts the user to start a session.
- For each task category (e.g., "Practise theory", "Work"), it displays three options for the user to choose from.
- Logs the chosen task or skips it if the user decides not to engage with that task.
- Asks whether the user completed a full session and logs this information.
- Saves all interactions in a date-stamped text file for record-keeping or further analysis.

This simple but effective design can be integrated with other projects that need user interaction tracking, task management, or progress logging.
